A lot has been said about Vim by programmers. For something that is just yet another fancy hammer to help construct a program, too much has been said about it.

Yet I found most of it not constructive to my personal experience of using Vim. Too many people take an extreme position and vehemently speak for or against it, most likely because it becomes a belief attached to their identity, much like a religion.

So with the irony not lost on me, here's what I have to say about Vim, and whether it's worth learning:

Vim is a trade-off involving time. To an experienced Vimmer, it supposedly greatly increases productivity. But to get to that experience where you are supposedly [coding like a samurai](https://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/03/27/vim-speed-is-not-really-the-point/) you need to invest time into learning this complicated multimodal paradigm for editing text.

As someone who invested a decent chunk of this time, it sure _feels_ faster and I am probably not going back to the standard way. But has it actually increased my productivity? I cannot tell as of now.

So if I am ever asked about whether one should learn Vim, I'd recommend against using it. Because the learning cost is huge and the benefit gained from it is, in my opinion, largely varying from person-to-person. So its worth is not clear. [^1]

And this, shall be the first and last time I write about Vim.
