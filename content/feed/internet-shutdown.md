You'd think it's easy to agree that internet shutdowns are an uncontroversially terrible idea, except the Indian Government loves to do them so much, that I don't even know anymore.

Human rights violations and suppression of freedom reasons aside — it is still so painfully destructive. Economic productivity is ruined and a lot of critical systems rely on the internet. It causes more chaos as information is no more easily verifiable and people would rely more on hearsay.

And you end up with scenarios straight out of a dark comedy.

It's worth noting that if your area faces frequent internet shutdowns, it's nice to keep [these](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/internet-shutdown-toolkit-list-of-messaging-apps-that-will-work-without-internet)  in stock.
