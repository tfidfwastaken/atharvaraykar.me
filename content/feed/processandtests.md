A test evaluates the outcome of a process.

A good way to know if a system is not doing well is if the process is designed around the test, or to put it more bluntly, the process is hacked to optimize for the test.[^1] 

Examples that come to mind:

- Schools, where teaching is more about making students do well in their test rather than sharing knowledge and making people curious and critical thinkers.
- The Governments that modify the statistical criteria to make their economic growth look better.
- p-value hacking in scientific journals.

Looks nice until we have to clean the mess of unemployable people taught to learn by rote, bad governance and bad science.

[^1]: I feel like I read a similar idea expressed somewhere on the internet recently but cannot put a finger to what and by whom it was. Oopsie. I'll update this entry if I do find out.
