I had a random thought – what if the Indian Government open-sourced their software? A quick search showed me that they actually do, to some extent.
In fact they have a whole platform that hosts repositories for a whole lot of... you'll see.

### Openforge

Around 2015 the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY)[^1] made a bunch of policies that provided a framework for government source code in repositories and stuff.

Fast forward to 2017 and the government brought in Amit Ranjan as the architect of Openforge. Interestingly, Amit Ranjan comes the startup world and was the co-founder and COO of SlideShare.
No wonder the site looks prettier than what you'd typically expect from the Indian Government.
