This blog is going to be very random initially and hopefully it shapes up into something I like. Right now focus is on quantity over quality (hence this post exists).

As of now this blog is what my twitter account would have looked like had I used twitter. But unlike twitter this echo chamber is superior because it is only me, so it's more echoey. The hollowness due to lack of traffic here should help to some effect too.

I was probably gonna write about "The Strange, Delightful and Mysterious World of IRC Channels" in an investigative style Ã  la Reply All podcast, but it turns out IRC channels are dead hollow boring places where people talk something about nothing. Metaphor for this blog.
